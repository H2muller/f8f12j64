<h1>Data Usage Policy: Sorghum bicolor v3.1.1</h1>
<h2>Restrictions on dataset usage</h2><p><b>I would like to use this data to help clone a gene, analyse a gene
        family, etc.</b><br>
      Please use this data to advance your studies. Please cite "<b>Sorghum
        bicolor&nbsp;</b> v3.1 DOE-JGI, http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/".</p>
    <p><b>I would like to do a large-scale comparison of <i>Sorghum bicolor </i>to
        other genomes, and/or a global analysis of its gene content</b>.<br>
      As a public service, the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute
      (JGI) is making the updated <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> genome sequence
      available before scientific publication according to the Ft. Lauderdale
      Accord. This balances the imperative of the DOE and the JGI that the data
      from its sequencing projects be made available as soon and as completely
      as possible with the desire of contributing scientists and the JGI to
      reserve a reasonable period of time to publish on the genome sequencing
      and analysis without concerns about preemption by other groups.
      JGI policy is that early release should aid the progress of science. <b>By
        accessing these data, you agree not to publish any articles containing
        analyses of genes or genomic data on a whole genome or chromosome scale
        prior to publication by JGI and/or its collaborators of a comprehensive
        genome analysis ("Reserved Analyses")</b>. "Reserved analyses" include
      the identification of complete (whole genome) sets of genomic features
      such as genes, gene families, regulatory elements, repeat structures, GC
      content, or any other genome feature, and whole-genome- or chromosome-
      scale comparisons with other species.
      The embargo on publication of Reserved Analyses by researchers outside of
      the <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> Genome Sequencing Project is expected to
      extend until the publication of the results of the sequencing project is
      accepted. Scientific users are free to publish papers dealing with
      specific genes or small sets of genes using the sequence data. If these
      data are used for publication, the following acknowledgment should be
      included:<b> 'These sequence data were produced by the US Department of
        Energy Joint Genome Institute'</b>. This letter has been circulated to
      Journal Editors so that they are aware of the conditions of access and
      publication detailed above.
      These data may be freely downloaded and used by all who respect the
      restrictions in the previous paragraphs. The assembly and sequence data
      should not be redistributed or repackaged without permission from the JGI.
      Any redistribution of the data during the embargo period should carry this
      notice: <b>"The Joint Genome Institute provides these data in good faith,
        but makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor assumes any legal
        liability or responsibility for any purpose for which the data are used.
        Once the sequence is moved to unreserved status, the data will be freely
        available for any subsequent use</b>."
    </p>

      We prefer that potential users of this sequence assembly contact the
      individuals listed under <b>Contacts</b> with their plans to ensure that
      proposed usage of sequence data are not considered Reserved Analyses.
